# Reaction Time Analysis - Auditory vs. Visual Stimuli

## Goal
Analyze a publicly available cognitive reaction time dataset to explore differences in how participants respond to auditory versus visual stimuli. 

## Research Questions
-How do reaction times differ between auditory and visual stimuli?
- What is the variability (standard deviation) in responses?
- Are there patterns of missing data?
